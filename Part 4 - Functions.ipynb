    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to learn about functions. In computer science terms, functions are known as subroutines. A **subroutine** is defined as a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task, packaged together as a unit - i.e. a small independent piece of code. Before we talk about how to define and use functions, it's important to know why we want to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first reason for using functions is *reusability*. It stems from a methodology  called **Don't Repeat Yourself** (**DRY** for short). This methodology boils down to the idea that we want to be as concise as possible when writing code - we don't want to write unnecessary instructions, and want to avoid repeating the same or similar instructions over and over. Functions allow us to achieve this goal by giving us a tool that we can use to wrap up a set of instructions into a single independent unit. That independent unit can then be used to perform a specific task over and over, without needing to rewrite those instructions. They are written just once, in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason we want to use functions is *abstraction*, which is the idea that a tool can be useful to user even if they have no idea how it works under the hood. This has two benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it allows callers of the function to not be concerned with how the function itself works. Rather, they stay safe in the assumption that the function will work (know, though, that this assumption does not always prove true, in which case you'll have to do some of your own trouble shooting). This allows functionality to be easily shared, and makes it easier to build more complex things. By using functions that other people have built, you're able to stand on their shoulders and build more complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, since the implementation is hidden from the caller, that actual implementation can change (so long as those four things listed above stay the same) and the caller won't know the difference. This makes it easy to split up problems into smaller pieces, and when something in one of those pieces needs to change, it won't affect the rest of the pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our programming journey so far, we've actually seen a number of functions:\n",
    "* `len()` returns the length of an inputted iterable\n",
    "* `range()` returns a list of numbers from an inputted minimum number to an inputted maximum number\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many built-in functions that are available in Python, and you can find them [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of these functions is constructed in a very similar way, and they all take some arbitrary number of arguments. Now we'll learn how to define our own functions in such a way that we can use them as we have been using the built-ins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining New Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we're going to figure out how to do is actually define functions. To build up to this, let's take a look back at some code we previously wrote to output a list of all of the even elements in `some_collection`."

This is because the function immediately gives back our `evens` list as soon as it encounters that `return evens` statement. When we called `get_evens()` above, it encountered that `return` statement in our first iteration through our `for` loop, when `element` was equal to `0`. As a result, `0` got appended to the `evens` list, and then in the next line that `evens` list got returned from the function.\n",

How do we specify a default parameter value for a function? It's actually pretty simple.

Meanwhile, when we pass in other values, we get the same results as we saw when no default value was set.

Let's first modify our function so that we by default return a list of evens from the user inputted range, defined by `n`, but also give the user the option to input a different divisor (instead of 2 for the evens) that will then return numbers in the inputted range that are divisible by the inputted divisor (i.e. the multiples of that number).

    "#### Calling Functions with Positional Versus Keyword Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, when we call a function and pass arguments to it we have seen Python assign those arguments to the correct parameters (for example, 5 to `n` and 2 to `divisor`, above). But how exactly does this happen - how does Python know that when we call `get_multiples(5, 2)`, 5 should get assigned to `n` and 2 should get assigned to `divisor`?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that, by default, Python simply matches up the position of the arguments that are passed in with the position of the parameters that are given in the function definition. In our `get_multiples(5, 2)` call, it takes the first argument passed, `5`, and assigns that to the first parameter in the function definition, `n`. Similarly, it takes the second argument passed, `2`, and assigns it to the second parameter in the function definition, `divisor`. This method of passing arguments is **by position**, and the arguments `5` and `2` in this example are considered to be **positional arguments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed from the title of this section, there is another method of passing arguments, and that is **by keyword**. The way this works is that instead of passing just the values in the function call, we call the values with the parameter name that they correspond to followed by an equals sign. Building off of our example above, using **keyword arguments** would mean our function call would look like this: `get_multiples(n=5, divisor=2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, got it! But, there are one or two more things that we need to cover with regards to this topic. In the above examples, we used either **all** positional arguments or **all** keyword arguments. However, there is the possibility that we can use a mixture of positional and keyword arguments if we'd like. The only caveat is that we have to pass all positional arguments **before** passing any keyword arguments. For example:"

    "Variable scope is a topic in and of itself, but up until now we haven't really had a good reason to discuss it. **Variable scope** is going to define the part (or block) of your program in which a variable is visible. We typically refer to one of two scopes for variables - **global** scope and **local** scope. A variable with **global** scope is visible everywhere. It can be used anywhere in your script, including any of the functions you have written (it can even be used inside of a function written inside of a function). A variable with **local** scope, on the other hand, is only visible in the scope in which it is enclosed (typically a function).\n",

    "3. The scope of the module (i.e. script) that contains the code (often referred to as the **global** scope).\n",
