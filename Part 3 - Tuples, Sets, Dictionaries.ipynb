For example, if you're allowing a user of your program to have access to a data structure, one way to ensure that they won't mess with it (sometimes users do this out of malice, and we want to try and prevent it) is to make the structure **immutable**. \n",

Changing a variable, then, simply amounts to associating that name with a different thing in memory.\n",

Similar to lists, tuples are declared by passing an iterable to the `tuple()` constructor, with the syntactic sugary parenthesis, or without parenthesis (this works because Python automatically interprets comma separated things that aren't specifically specified otherwise as tuples)."
