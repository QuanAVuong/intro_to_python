This exact same procedure was followed the third time, but the trailing 0 on the `float` version of 8 was left off. Python doesn't need to see anything following the decimal point to know it should be interpreting the number as a `float`, so long as the \".\" is there. Similarly, we can manually cast the output of the 4th operation as an `int` by passing the result directly to the `int()` constructor. Manually casting in this way can be very useful when Python is interpreting things differently than you would like it to. The last operation that we performed is called floor division, `//`. Really, all it does is perform division and truncate the result. So, where `7 / 8.` gave us `0.875`, `7 // 8.` cuts off after the `0.` giving us `0.0`.\n",

One that comes to mind is the use of `i` to keep track of an index (we will cover this idea next week, but it wouldn't be surprising if you understood the concept already). Because of its prevalent usage for this purpose, it is usually easy to understand what is happening in that context, and the lack of descriptiveness is okay.

We would need to write an `if` statement that identifies whether or not a number is even (we'll talk about how to do this), and then give back only those that meet the even condition. This is a program that will be entirely within our ability to implement at the end of the day; for now though, let's focus on the `if` statement.\n",

The `else` is similar, but it doesn't accept a condition. Instead, it mainly acts as a catch all for any other situation that you don't need to cover with your `if`s and `elif`s.
